It's Business Time
------------------

Apps live and die on their traffic. And on the modern web, the majority of **traffic comes from search engines and social media**. If you want your site to be seen by anyone, then you need to design for SEO and SMO -- and that means pre-rendering your app using [static or server rendering](https://frontarm.com/james-k-nelson/static-vs-server-rendering/).

There's just one problem: real-world apps are ***big***.

Imagine if Facebook sent all its data and JavaScript code with each request. *It'd break the internet.* Indeed, if you take a look around the industry, **the vast majority of real-world apps rely on some kind of asynchronous data** -- whether it's fetched from an API, pulled from a database, or dynamically imported from code-split bundles. For the most part, React handles this asynchronous data pretty well; hooks or lifecycle methods make it easy to show a loading spinner until the data is ready. But there's a catch.

<Doc.AsideTop>

**Outside of the browser, hooks and lifecycle methods don't work so well**. This is because React takes a completely different approach to rendering; on the browser, you call `ReactDOM.render()`, while on the server, you use `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()`. And while `renderToString()` will happily render your page's *initial* content, this doesn't help when the initial content is a loading spinner.

<Doc.Details aside title="What about React Suspense?">

Suspense is a new React API that allows React to suspend rendering until something happens. When [Suspense for Server Rendering](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/11/27/react-16-roadmap.html#suspense-for-server-rendering) is released, it'll become much easier to statically render asynchronous content.

Of course, Navi does much more than waiting for content: it also gives you a way to compose mappings from URLs to data. *Suspense will just make Navi's job easier.* In fact, Navi already uses Suspense to wait for the initial render!

Now as you probably know, the React ecosystem *does* have a number of tools that help with pre-rendering and asynchronous data. For example, Next.js gives you [`getInitialProps()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/#fetching-data-and-component-lifecycle), and Gatsby lets you hide the entire filesystem [behind GraphQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/querying-with-graphql/). And while both of these approaches *work*, they're super complicated. They have their own framework and build systems, and are full-fledged ecosystems in their own right. Which is great and all, but...

**What if all you *really* needed was a way to get your page's content *before* calling `renderToString()`?**

A Router/Fetcher
----------------

Navi is a JavaScript library for mapping URLs to content; it's a router. But Navi has a difference from other routers: the content can be asynchronous, and it can be *anything*. It lets you map URLs to data, views, or even HTTP headers -- and then lets you easily compose these mappings. **It makes getting all of a URL's content as easy as waiting for a promise to resolve.**

```js
//--- index.js
import { createBrowserNavigation, lazy, mount, redirect } from 'navi'
import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server'

async function main() {
  // Set up your routes
  let navi = createBrowserNavigation({
    routes: mount({
      '/': redirect('/quotes/1'),
      '/quotes/:id': lazy(() => import('./quotesRoute'))
    })
  })

  // Wait for the content to load
  let route = await navi.getRoute()
  
  // Then render the route!
  document.body.innerHTML = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(route.data)
}

main()
//--- quotesRoute.js
import React from 'react'
import { route } from 'navi'

const quotes = {
  1: "It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes.",
  2: "The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don’t.",
  3: "Don't Panic.",
  42: "“Forty-two,” said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.",
}

export default route({
  getData: ({ params }) => (
    <blockquote>
      {quotes[params.id]}
    </blockquote>
  )
})
```

The above example demonstrates why static and server rendering is so much easier with Navi: **it moves your routing and initial data fetching code out of synchronous React components, and into async functions.**

Of course, in a *real* app you'd also need to deal with:

- Nested layouts and routes
- Visualizing route transitions with a loading bar
- `<meta>` and `<title>` tags for SEO
- Updating scroll positions after content loads
- Building a list of your app's statically renderable URLs
- Creating HTML files for each of your statically renderable pages

Navi is flexible enough to handle all of this, but it again takes a different approach to existing frameworks. Where possible, **Navi integrates with existing tools and libraries:**

- It uses react-helmet to manage your `<title>` and `<head>`
- It can statically build create-react-app projects -- *without ejecting*
- It lets you gradually transition to static rendering, by working [alongside react-router](../integrations/react-router)
