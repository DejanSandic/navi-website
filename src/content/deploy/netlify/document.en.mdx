[Netlify](http://netlify.com) is an all-in-one platform for automating modern web projects that allows you to deploy your Navi projects either by [command line](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/) or [git push](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/) on your personal domain or a free `.netlify.com` suffixed URL. It is especially focused on delivering [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org) sites like the statically rendered ones generated by Navi.

This guide will show you how you can deploy a Navi project in just a few steps:

## Step 1: Getting Started with Navi

If you haven't already set up your Navi-based project, use [Create React Navi App](../../create-react-navi-app/#create-react-navi-app) to bootstrap one.

## Step 2: Getting Netlify CLI

You can install Netlify CLI with npm:

```shell
npm i -g netlify-cli
```

## Step 3: Configuring your Navi App

Once you are ready to deploy your Navi app, add a `netlify.toml` file to the root of your project:

```toml
## netlify.toml
[build]
  command = "yarn build" # specify what command to use to build
  publish = "build" # name/location of the built folder to publish
```

Then run this to preview/deploy your site:

```shell
yarn build && netlify deploy ## or `netlify deploy --prod` to opt out of previewing
```

If you have your site linked to GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket, you can also just `git push origin master` and have your site [continuously deployed by Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/).

That's it! There are a lot more power user features to Netlify, you should check the [docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/) or [contact Support](https://www.netlify.com/support/) if you need help!
