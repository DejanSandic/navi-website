**Declarative, asynchronous routing for React.**

Navi is a JavaScript library for declaratively mapping URLs to asynchronous content. With Navi, you use simple functions, Promises and `async`/`await` to map your app's URLs to data and views.

Navi comes with a set of modern React components that take advantage of Suspense and Hooks. And as icing on the cake, Navi is designed to make pre-rendering for SEO a breeze -- it even lets you statically render your app *without ejecting from create-react-app!*

## Try Navi.

Navi is just a library, and so it works great with both new and existing apps.

```bash
npm install navi react-navi
```

The quickest way to try Navi is to play with the embedded editor below. It demonstrates how to implement this documentation site, including the basics of routing, linking, code splitting, generating a list of a site's pages, and SEO.

To quickly try Navi in a new project, you can start with a create-react-app based template:

-   [create-react-navi-app](./create-react-navi-app/#create-react-navi-app)<br />
    *Creates a project skeleton using create-react-app, then adds a couple apps and static rendering.*

-   [create-react-blog](./create-react-navi-app/#create-react-blog)<br />
    *Creates a project skeleton using create-react-app, then adds routes generated from your filesystem structure, static rendering, pagination, tags, [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), an RSS feed, a Netlify deploy script, and a theme inspired by Dan Abramov's [overreacted.io](http://overreacted.io), for a ready-to-go blog.*

Or if you'd like to see how simple it is to add Navi to your own create-react-app project, head on over to [Getting Started](./guides/getting-started/) guide.

Oh, and if you already have an app built with react-router? Then adding Navi is ridiculously easy -- just mount your Navi routes within a react-router `<Route>`. For details, see the guide to [integrating with react-router](./integrations/react-router).

## This site uses Navi. Here's how it works.

```jsx
//--- index.js
import React, { Suspense } from 'react'
import { Navi } from 'react-navi'
import Layout from './Layout'
import routes from './routes'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Suspense fallback={<Layout />}>
    <Navi routes={routes} />
  </Suspense>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
//--- routes.js 
import { map, route } from 'navi'

export default mount({
  '/': route({
    title: 'Start Here',
  }),

  '/motivation': route({
    title: 'Why Navi?',
  })

  '/getting-started': route({
    title: 'Getting Started',
  })
})
```
