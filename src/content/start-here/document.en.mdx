**Declarative, asynchronous routing for React.**

Navi is a JavaScript library for declaratively mapping URLs to asynchronous content. With Navi, you use simple functions, Promises and `async`/`await` to map your app's URLs to data and views.

Navi comes with a set of modern React components that take advantage of Suspense and Hooks. And as icing on the cake, Navi is designed to make pre-rendering for SEO a breeze -- it even lets you statically render your app *without ejecting from create-react-app!*

## Try Navi.

Navi is just a library, and so it works great with both new and existing apps.

```bash
npm install navi react-navi
```

The quickest way to try Navi is to play with the embedded editor below. It demonstrates how to implement a simple site selling hats and flamethrowers, including the basics of routing, linking, code splitting, and SEO.

To quickly try Navi in a new project, you can start with a create-react-app based template:

-   [create-react-navi-app](./create-react-navi-app/#create-react-navi-app)<br />
    *Creates a project skeleton using create-react-app, then adds a couple apps and static rendering.*

-   [create-react-blog](./create-react-navi-app/#create-react-blog)<br />
    *Creates a project skeleton using create-react-app, then adds routes generated from your filesystem structure, static rendering, pagination, tags, [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), an RSS feed, a Netlify deploy script, and a theme inspired by Dan Abramov's [overreacted.io](http://overreacted.io), for a ready-to-go blog.*

Or if you'd like to see how simple it is to add Navi to your own create-react-app project, head on over to [Getting Started](./guides/getting-started/) guide.

Oh, and if you already have an app built with react-router? Then adding Navi is ridiculously easy -- just mount your Navi routes within a react-router `<Route>`. For details, see the guide to [integrating with react-router](./integrations/react-router).

## Try a live example.

```jsx
//---
viewerURL: /product/hat
//--- index.js <-- index.js
//--- product.js <-- product.js
//--- Landing.js <-- Landing.js
//--- Layout.js <-- Layout.js
//--- api.js <-- api.js
//--- styles.css <-- styles.css
```
