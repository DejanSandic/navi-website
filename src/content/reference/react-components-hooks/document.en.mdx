## `<Link>`

This component can be used as a drop-in replacement for `<a>` tags. Internally, it renders an `<a>` tag so that statically rendered links will work even if JavaScript is disabled.

### Props

#### `active`: `boolean` <small>(optional)</small>

Allows you to explicit enable or disable the `activeClassName` and `activeStyle` props.

#### `activeClassName`: `string` <small>(optional)</small>

Will be added to your link's `className` if the app's current URL matches the `href` prop, or if the `active` prop is set to `true`.

#### `activeStyle`: `object` <small>(optional)</small>

Will be merged into your link's `style` if the app's current URL matches the `href` prop, or if the `active` prop is set to `true`.

#### `exact`: `bool` <small>(optional)</small>

If true, the link will only be considered to "match" the current URL if it is an *exact* match.

By default, a partial match at the beginning of the current URL will also be considered a match. This facilitates nav links, which often need to be highlighted when child pages are active.

#### `href`: `string` <small>(required)</small>

The url to navigate to; identical to the `href` attribute of a HTML `<a>` tag.

#### `prefetch`: `boolean` <small>(optional)</small>

If specified, the linked page's content will be fetched as soon as the link is rendered.


## `<NotFoundBoundary>`

You can wrap a `<NotFoundBoundary>` around a view to show a "not found" message when no route can be found to be rendered by the view.

### Props

#### `render: (error: NotFoundError) => React.Node`

### Example

```js
function Layout() {
  return (
    <NotFoundBoundary render={() =>
      <h1>Not Found</h1>
    }>
      <View />
    </NotFoundBoundary>
  )
}
```


## `<Router>`

Your app's `<Router>` component is responsible for subscribing to the latest navigation state, and passing that state to Navi's *other* components.

By default, `<Router>` creates a [`navigation`](../navigation) object internally, passing through the `routes`, `basename`, `context` and `history` props. However, if you'd like to define your `navigation` object manually -- i.e. for static or server rendering support -- then you can pass it in via the `navigation` prop.

### Props

#### `navigation`: [`Navigation`](../navigation/)

Your app's `Navigation` object, as returned from [`createBrowserNavigation()`](../navigation/#createbrowsernavigation) or [`createMemoryNavigation()`](../navigation/#creatememorynavigation)

By default, this will be created internally.

#### `basename`: `string` <small>(optional)</small>

The `basename` to use for the created `navigation` object. Only used when a `navigation` prop is not manually supplied.

#### `children`: `React.ReactNode` <small>(optional)</small>

If you don't pass in any children, then a [`<View>`](#view) will be rendered by default.

#### `context`: `Context` <small>(optional)</small>

The `<Router>` object will keep your `navigation` object's context in sync with this prop by calling it's [`setContext()`](../navigation/#navigationsetcontext) method.

This will be used even if you supply a `navigation` prop.

#### `history`: `History` <small>(optional)</small>

The `history` to use for the created `navigation` object. Only used when a `navigation` prop is not manually supplied.

#### `routes`: [`Matcher`](../matchers/)

The `routes` to use for the created `navigation` object. Only used when a `navigation` prop is not manually supplied.


## `<View>`

Renders the content for the next matched view that hasn't already been rendered.

If the content is a React element or component, then the `children` render function is optional, and that content will be rendered by default. Otherwise, you'll need to provide a child function to specify how to render the route content. 

### Suspense

When the page initially loads, it can be the case that *no* content is available -- even for previous routes. In this case, `<View>` will use React Suspense to pause execution until content is available. However, React requires you to wrap the suspended `<View>` with a [`<Suspense fallback>`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactsuspense), so that you can decide what will be shown in place of the not-yet-ready content. If you've used [`React.lazy()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#suspense), then this should be familiar -- otherwise, check out the example below.

As React doesn't yet support Suspense for server-side rendering, you'll want to avoid using `<Suspense>` for statically rendered apps. Instead, wait for Navi's initial content to render before calling `ReactDOMServer.render()` by creating a custom `navigation` object and using its [`navigation.getRoute()`](../navigation/#navigationgetroute) function, before passing the `navigation` object to your [`<Router>`](#router) component's `navigation` prop.

### Props

#### <code>children: (view, route) => React.ReactNode</code> <small>(optional)</small>

If provided, the component's `children` must be a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) that receives the view's value as its first argument, and the current [Route](../data-types/#route) as its second.

If a `children` prop is not provided, the default behavior is to render the next unrendered view from `route.views`.

### Examples

#### Basic Usage

A `<View>` can be placed anywhere inside a `<Router>` component -- it doesn't have to be a direct descendent. You'll often want your `<View>` to be nested within a `<Suspense>` component, or a `<Layout>` component, like so:

```jsx
import { Router, View } from 'react-navi'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router navigation={navigation}>
    <Layout>
      <View />
    </Layout>
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

#### Usage with render prop

By suppling a render prop, you can manually decide how to render the next unrendered view. This makes it possible to specify view objects other than React elements and components

```jsx
<View>
  {(view, route) => 
    React.isValidElement(content)
      ? content
      : React.createElement(content)
  }
</View>
```

#### Usage with React Suspense

By wrapping your content in a React [`<Suspense>`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactsuspense) element, you can specify a fallback element to display while your app's initial content is loading.

Note that until `<Suspense>` gets server-rendering support, this only makes sense for apps that are *not* pre-rendered with `ReactDOMServer.render()`. For static or server rendered apps, use [`navigation.getRoute()`](../navigation/#navigationgetroute) to wait for the initial content to load before hydrating the pre-rendered HTML with `ReactDOM.hydrate()`.

```js
import React, { Suspense } from 'react'
import { Router, View } from 'react-navi'
import Layout from './Layout'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router routes={routes}>
    <Layout>
      <Suspense fallback={null}>
        <View />
      </Suspense>
    </Layout>
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```


## `useCurrentRoute()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that allows you to access the latest non-busy [`Route`](../data-types/#route), which contains all information that Navi knows about the current page, including:

- `data`
- `title`
- `url`
- `views`
- etc.

*You can also access the result of `useCurrentRoute()` by passing a child function to the `<CurrentRoute>` component, similar to the API for React context consumers.*

### Example

You can use `useCurrentRoute()` to retrieve the current page's `title`, and display it as part of a `<Layout>` component.

```js
import { useCurrentRoute } from 'react-navi'

function Layout({ children }) {
  let route = useCurrentRoute()

  return (
    <div className="Layout">
      <h1>{route.title}</h1>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```


## `useLoadingRoute()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that outputs the [`Route`](../data-types/#route) object for any page whose content is currently being fetched. If no page is currently being fetched, then it outputs `undefined`.

Use `useLoadingRoute()` to display a loading overlay when the user has requested a navigation that hasn't completed yet.

*You can also access the result of `useLoadingRoute()` by passing a child function to the `<LoadingRoute>` component, similar to the API for React context consumers.*

### Example

```js
import { useLoadingRoute } from 'react-navi'

function Layout({ children }) {
  let loadingRoute = useLoadingRoute()

  return (
    <div className="Layout">
      <BusyIndicator show={!!loadingRoute} />
      { children }
    </div>
  )
}
```


## `useNavigation()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that returns your app's [`navigation`](../navigation/) store, which can be used to facilitate [programmatic navigation](../../guides/programmatic-navigation).

*You can also access the result of `useNavigation()` by passing a child function to the `<NaviConsumer>` component, similar to the API for React context consumers.*


### Example

You can use `useNavigation()` to programmatically navigate after a form is successfully submitted.

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { useNavigation } from 'react-navi'

function EmailForm() {
  let navigation = useNavigation()
  let [email, setEmail] = useState()

  function handleSubmit() {
    navigation.navigate('/thanks')
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="EmailForm">
      <input value={email} onChange={e => setEmail(e.target.value)} />
      <button>Join 13,000 other subscribers</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
