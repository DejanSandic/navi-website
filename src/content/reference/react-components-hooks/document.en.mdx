## `<Link>`

This component can be used as a drop-in replacement for `<a>` tags. Internally, it renders an `<a>` tag so that statically rendered links will work even if JavaScript is disabled.

### Props

#### `active`: `boolean` <small>(optional)</small>

Allows you to explicit enable or disable the `activeClassName` and `activeStyle` props.

#### `activeClassName`: `string` <small>(optional)</small>

Will be added to your link's `className` if the app's current URL matches the `href` prop, or if the `active` prop is set to `true`.

#### `activeStyle`: `object` <small>(optional)</small>

Will be merged into your link's `style` if the app's current URL matches the `href` prop, or if the `active` prop is set to `true`.

#### `exact`: `bool` <small>(optional)</small>

If true, the link will only be considered to "match" the current URL if it is an *exact* match.

By default, a partial match at the beginning of the current URL will also be considered a match. This facilitates nav links, which often need to be highlighted when child pages are active.

#### `href`: `string` <small>(required)</small>

The url to navigate to; identical to the `href` attribute of a HTML `<a>` tag.

#### `prefetch`: `HTTPMethod` <small>(optional)</small>

If specified, the linked page's content will be fetched as soon as the link is rendered, using the specified method.

By default, links will be fetched using the HEAD method. Set this to `null` if you'd like to disable prefetch.


## `<NaviProvider>`

Your app's `<NaviProvider>` component is responsible for subscribing to the latest navigation state, and passing that state to Navi's *other* components.

`<NaviProvider>` is used internally by `<Router>`. If you are not using a `<Router>` component, then all other components must be rendered inside a `<NaviProvider>` instead.

### Props

#### `navigation`: [`Navigation`](../navigation/)

Your app's `Navigation` object, as returned from [`createBrowserNavigation()`](../navigation/#createbrowsernavigation) or [`createMemoryNavigation()`](../navigation/#creatememorynavigation)


## `<NotFoundBoundary>`

You can wrap a `<NotFoundBoundary>` around a view to show a "not found" message when no route can be found to be rendered by the view.

### Props

#### `render: (error: NotFoundError) => React.Node`

### Example

```js
function Layout() {
  return (
    <NotFoundBoundary render={() =>
      <h1>Not Found</h1>
    }>
      <View />
    </NotFoundBoundary>
  )
}
```


## `<Router>`

When you don't need static rendering, you can wrap your app in a `<Router>` component to set up routing.

Creates a [`navigation`](../navigation) object with the specified props, and passes it to an internal [`<NaviProvider>`](#naviprovider).

If you don't pass in any children, then a [`<View>`](#view) will be rendered by default.

### Props

#### `routes`: [`Matcher`](../matchers/)

#### `basename`: `string` <small>(optional)</small>

#### `children`: `React.ReactNode` <small>(optional)</small>

#### `context`: `Context` <small>(optional)</small>

#### `history`: `History` <small>(optional)</small>


## `<View>`

Renders the content for the next matched view that hasn't already been rendered.

If the content is a React element or component, then the `children` render function is optional, and that content will be rendered by default. Otherwise, you'll need to provide a child function to specify how to render the route content. 

### Suspense

When the page initially loads, it can be the case that *no* content is available -- even for previous routes. In this case, `<View>` will use React Suspense to pause execution until content is available. However, React requires you to wrap the suspended `<View>` with a [`<Suspense fallback>`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactsuspense), so that you can decide what will be shown in place of the not-yet-ready content. If you've used [`React.lazy()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#suspense), then this should be familiar -- otherwise, check out the example below.

As React doesn't yet support Suspense for server-side rendering, you'll want to avoid using `<Suspense>` for statically rendered apps. Instead, wait for Navi's initial content to render before calling `ReactDOMServer.render()` by creating a custom `navigation` object and using its [`navigation.steady()`](../navigation/#navigationsteady) function. Note that you'll also need to pass the navigation to a [`<NaviProvider>`](#naviprovider) component instead of using `<Router>`.

### Props

#### <code>children: (view, route) => React.ReactNode</code> <small>(optional)</small>

If provided, the component's `children` must be a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) that receives the view's value as its first argument, and the current [Route](../data-types/#route) as its second.

If a `children` prop is not provided, the default behavior is to render the next unrendered view from `route.views`.

### Examples

#### Basic Usage

A `<View>` can be placed anywhere inside a `<Router>` or `<NaviProvider>` component -- it doesn't have to be a direct descendent. In fact, because `<View>` components can pause rendering with React Suspense, you'll often want to wrap them in a `<Suspense>` component.

```jsx
import { NaviProvider, View } from 'react-navi'

ReactDOM.render(
  <NaviProvider navigation={navigation}>
    <Layout>
      <View />
    </Layout>
  </NaviProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

#### Usage with render prop

By suppling a render prop, you can manually decide how to render the next unrendered view. This makes it possible to specify view objects other than React elements and components

```jsx
<View>
  {(view, route) => 
    React.isValidElement(content)
      ? content
      : React.createElement(content)
  }
</View>
```

#### Usage with React Suspense

By wrapping your content in a React [`<Suspense>`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactsuspense) element, you can specify a fallback element to display while your app's initial content is loading.

Note that this only makes sense for apps that are *not* pre-rendered with `ReactDOMServer.render()`. For static or server rendered apps, use [`navigation.steady()`](../navigation/#navigationsteady) to wait for the initial content to load before hydrating the pre-rendered HTML with `ReactDOM.hydrate()`.

```js
import React, { Suspense } from 'react'
import { Router, View } from 'react-navi'
import Layout from './Layout'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router routes={routes}>
    <Layout>
      <Suspense fallback={null}>
        <View />
      </Suspense>
    </Layout>
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```


## `useCurrentRoute()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that allows you to access the latest non-busy [`Route`](../data-types/#route), which contains all information that Navi knows about the current page, including:

- `data`
- `title`
- `url`
- `views`
- etc.

*You can also access the result of `useCurrentRoute()` by passing a child function to the `<CurrentRoute>` component, similar to the API for React context consumers.*

### Example

You can use `useCurrentRoute()` to retrieve the current page's `title`, and display it as part of a `<Layout>` component.

```js
import { useCurrentRoute } from 'react-navi'

function Layout({ children }) {
  let route = useCurrentRoute()

  return (
    <div className="Layout">
      <h1>{route.title}</h1>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```


## `useLoadingRoute()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that outputs the [`Route`](../data-types/#route) object for any page whose content is currently being fetched. If no page is currently being fetched, then it outputs `undefined`.

Use `useLoadingRoute()` to display a loading overlay when the user has requested a navigation that hasn't completed yet.

*You can also access the result of `useLoadingRoute()` by passing a child function to the `<LoadingRoute>` component, similar to the API for React context consumers.*

### Example

```js
import { useLoadingRoute } from 'react-navi'

function Layout({ children }) {
  let loadingRoute = useLoadingRoute()

  return (
    <div className="Layout">
      <BusyIndicator show={!!loadingRoute} />
      { children }
    </div>
  )
}
```


## `useNavigation()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that returns your app's [`navigation`](../navigation/) store, which can be used to facilitate [programmatic navigation](../../guides/programmatic-navigation).

*You can also access the result of `useNavigation()` by passing a child function to the `<NaviConsumer>` component, similar to the API for React context consumers.*


### Example

You can use `useHistory()` to programmatically navigate after a form is successfully submitted.

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { useNavigation } from 'react-navi'

function EmailForm() {
  let navigation = useNavigation()
  let [email, setEmail] = useState()

  function handleSubmit() {
    navigation.navigate('/thanks')
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="EmailForm">
      <input value={email} onChange={e => setEmail(e.target.value)} />
      <button>Join 13,000 other subscribers</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
