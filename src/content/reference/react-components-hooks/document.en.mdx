## `<Link>`

This component can be used as a drop-in replacement for `<a>` tags. Internally, it renders an `<a>` tag so that statically rendered links will work even if JavaScript is disabled.

### Props

#### `active: boolean` <small>(optional)</small>

Allows you to explicit enable or disable the `activeClassName` and `activeStyle` props.

#### `activeClassName: string` <small>(optional)</small>

Will be added to your link's `className` if the app's current URL matches the `href` prop, or if the `active` prop is set to `true`.

#### `activeStyle: object` <small>(optional)</small>

Will be merged into your link's `style` if the app's current URL matches the `href` prop, or if the `active` prop is set to `true`.

#### `exact: bool` <small>(optional)</small>

If true, the link will only be considered to "match" the current URL if it is an *exact* match.

By default, a partial match at the beginning of the current URL will also be considered a match. This facilitates nav links, which often need to be highlighted when child pages are active.

#### `href: string` <small>(required)</small>

The url to navigate to; identical to the `href` attribute of a HTML `<a>` tag.

#### `precache: boolean` <small>(required)</small>

If specified, the linked page's content will be loaded as soon as the link is rendered.


## `<NaviProvider>`

Your app's `<NaviProvider>` component is responsible for subscribing to the latest navigation state, and passing that state to Navi's *other* components.

`<NaviProvider>` is used internally by `<Router>`. If you are not using a `<Router>` component, then all other components must be rendered inside a `<NaviProvider>` instead.

### Props

#### `navigation`: [`Navigation`](../navigation/)

Your app's `Navigation` object, as returned from [`createBrowserNavigation()`](../navigation/#createbrowsernavigation) or [`createMemoryNavigation()`](../navigation/#creatememorynavigation)


## `<NotFoundBoundary>`

Catches `NotFoundError` exceptions thrown by `<View />`.

### Props

#### `render: (error: NotFoundError) => React.Node`

### Example

```js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NaviProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <NavLoading>
          {loading =>
            <Nav.NotFoundBoundary render={() =>
              <h1>Not Found</h1>
            }>
              <div className="App">
                <BusyIndicator show={loading} />
                <View />
              </div>
            </Nav.NotFoundBoundary>
          }
        </NavLoading>
      </NaviProvider>
    );
  }
}
```


## `<Router>`

TODO


## `<View>`

Renders the content for the next matched view that hasn't already been rendered.

If the content is a React element or component, then the `children` render function is optional, and that content will be rendered by default. Otherwise, you'll need to provide a child function to specify how to render the route content. 

### Suspense

When the page initially loads, it can be the case that *no* content is available -- even for previous routes. In this case, `<View>` will use React Suspense to pause execution until content is available. However, React requires you to wrap the suspended `<View>` with a [`<Suspense fallback>`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactsuspense), so that you can decide what will be shown in place of the not-yet-ready content. If you've used [`React.lazy()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#suspense), then this should be familiar -- otherwise, check out the example below.

As React doesn't yet support Suspense for server-side rendering, you'll want to avoid using `<Suspense>` for statically rendered apps. Instead, wait for Navi's initial content to render before calling `ReactDOMServer.render()` by creating a custom `navigation` object and using its [`navigation.steady()`](../navigation/#navigationsteady) function. Note that you'll also need to pass the navigation to a [`<NaviProvider>`](#naviprovider) component instead of using `<Router>`.

### Props

#### <code>children: (view, route) => React.ReactNode</code> <small>(optional)</small>

If provided, the component's `children` must be a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) that receives the view's value as its first argument, and the current [Route](../data-types/#route) as its second.

If a `children` prop is not provided, the default behavior is to render the next unrendered view from `route.views`.

### Examples

#### Basic Usage

```js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NaviProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <div className="App">
          <View />
        </div>
      </NaviProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Usage with render prop

By suppling a render prop, you can manually decide how to render your next route segment's content.

```js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NaviProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <div className="App">
          <View>
            {content => 
              React.isValidElement(content)
                ? content
                : React.createElement(content)
            }
          </View>
        </div>
      </NaviProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Usage with React Suspense

*Available from react-navi* ***0.10+***

By wrapping your content in a React [`<Suspense>`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactsuspense) element, you can specify a fallback element to display while your app's initial content is loading.

Note that this only makes sense for apps that are *not* pre-rendered with `ReactDOMServer.render()`. For static or server rendered apps, use [`navigation.steady()`](../navigation/#navigationsteady) to wait for the initial content to load before hydrating the pre-rendered HTML with `ReactDOM.hydrate()`.

```js
import { Suspense } from 'react'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NaviProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <div className="App">
          <AppNavbar />
          <main>
            <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
              <View />
            </Suspense>
          </main>
        </div>
      </NaviProvider>
    );
  }
}
```


## `useCurrentRoute()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that allows you to access the latest non-busy [`Route`](../data-types/#route), which contains all information that Navi knows about the current page, including:

- `data`
- `title`
- `url`
- `views`
- etc.

*You can also access the result of `useCurrentRoute()` by passing a child function to the `<CurrentRoute>` component, similar to the API for React context consumers.*

### Example

```js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NaviProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <NavRoute>
          {route =>
            <div>Current URL: <strong>{route.url.href}</strong></div>
          }
        </NavRoute>
      </NaviProvider>
    );
  }
}
```


## `useHistory()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that returns your app's [`history`](../history) object, which can be used to facilitate [programmatic navigation](../../guides/programmatic-navigation).

*You can also access the result of `useLoadingRoute()` by passing a child function to the `<History>` component, similar to the API for React context consumers.*
 


## `useLoadingRoute()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that outputs the [`Route`](../data-types/#route) object for any page whose content is currently being fetched. If no page is currently being fetched, then it outputs `undefined`.

Use `useLoadingRoute()` to display a loading overlay when the user has requested a navigation that hasn't completed yet.

*You can also access the result of `useLoadingRoute()` by passing a child function to the `<LoadingRoute>` component, similar to the API for React context consumers.*

### Example

```js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NaviProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <NavLoading>
          {loadingRoute =>
            <div className="App">
              <BusyIndicator show={!!loadingRoute} />
              <View />
            </div>
          }
        </NavLoading>
      </NaviProvider>
    );
  }
}
```


## `useNavigation()`

A [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that returns your app's [`navigation`](../navigation/) store.

This hooks should not be necessary in most circumstances, but is available for completeness. If you need to access the `history` object, use the [`useHistory()`](#usehistory) hook instead.

*You can also access the result of `useNavigation()` by passing a child function to the `<NaviConsumer>` component, similar to the API for React context consumers.*
