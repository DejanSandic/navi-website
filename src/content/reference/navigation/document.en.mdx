Each Navi app has a `navigation` store that holds the app's current location, the [`router`](../router) object, and current route.

There are three ways to create a `Navigation` object:

1. The [`<Router>`](../react-components-hooks/#router) component internally creates a `navigation` store if you don't pass it a `navigation` prop.
2. [`createBrowserNavigation()`](#createbrowsernavigation) -- for use within the browser.
3. [`createMemoryNavigation()`](#creatememorynavigation) -- for use on server and within tests.

When you're not statically rendering your site, you'll typically just use the `<Router>` component. If you need to access the `navigation` store created by `<Router>`, then you can access it through the `useNavigation()` hook or `<NaviConsumer>` component.

When you *are* statically rendering, testing, or just want a little more control, you can manually create your `navigation` store and make it available to Navi's components and hooks using the `<NaviProvider>` component.


Your `navigation` object
------------------------

An Observable that manages your app's navigation state.


### `navigation.router`

A [`Router`](../router/) object, which you can use to manually resolve URLs to [`Route`](../data-types/#route)  objects.


### `navigation.getCurrentValue()`

```typescript
navigation.getCurrentValue(): Route
```

Returns the current [`Route`](../data-types/#route) -- even if it is not yet fully ready.


### `navigation.getSteadyValue()`

```typescript
navigation.getSteadyValue(): Promise<NavigationSnapshot>
```

Returns a promise to a *steady* [`Route`](../data-types/#route) -- i.e. one that will not have any further changes until the next navigation action.

Note that a steady Route can still contain errors or redirects -- the only guarantee is that it does not have status of `"busy"`.


### `navigation.setContext()`

```typescript
navigation.setContext(context)
```

Updates the [Routing Context](../../guides/routing-context) that is passed to the navigation's matchers.


### `navigation.steady()`

```typescript
navigation.steady(): Promise<void>
```

Returns a promise that resolves once the current route has a `status` property that is not `"busy"`. This will resolve at the same time as `navigation.getSteadyValue()`.


### `navigation.subscribe()`

```typescript
navigation.subscribe(listener: route => void)
```

Registers a callback that will be called each time that the current route changes, i.e. whenever the value that would be returned by `navigation.getCurrentValue()` changes.

The callback will be called with the latest [`Route`](../data-types/#route) object.

While this function gives you low level access to Navi's state, it's rare that you'll need to call it directly (unless you're writing an integration). It's far easier to subscribe through a component like [`<Router>`](../react-components-hooks/#router) or [`<NaviProvider>`](../react-components-hooks/#naviprovider).


## `createBrowserNavigation()`

Use `createBrowserNavigation()` to create a `navigation` object that is linked to the browser's history.

At minimum, you'll need to pass in a matcher to `routes`. You'll also often want to pass in a `context` object, which will be used as the initial value for your matcher's [Routing Context](../../guides/routing-context).

```typescript
createBrowserNavigation(options: {
  /**
   * The Matcher that declares your app's routes.
   */
  routes: Matcher,

  /**
   * If provided, this part of any URLs will be ignored. This is useful
   * for mounting a Navi app in a subdirectory on a domain.
   */
  basename?: string,

  /**
   * The initial Context for your matchers.
   */
  context?: any,

  /**
   * You can supply a history object as output by react-router, allowing
   * Navi and react-router to be used within the same app.
   */
  history?: History,
})
```

### Example

```js
let navigation = Navi.createBrowserNavigation({
  routes,
  context: {
    isAuthenticated,
  }
})
```


`createMemoryNavigation()`
--------------------------

Use `createMemoryNavigation()` to create a `navigation` object that is independent from any browser history. This is useful for server-side rendering and testing.

At minimum, you'll need to pass in a `routes` Matcher and a `url` or `request`.

```typescript
createMemoryNavigation(options: {
  /**
   * The Matcher that declares your app's routes.
   */
  routes: Matcher,

  /**
   * The initial URL or Request to match.
   */
  url?: string | Partial<URLDescriptor>,
  request?: {
    body?: any,
    headers?: { [name: string]: string },
    method?: HTTPMethod,
    url?: string | URLDescriptor,
  },

  /**
   * If provided, this part of any URLs will be ignored. This is useful
   * for mounting a Navi app in a subdirectory on a domain.
   */
  basename?: string,

  /**
   * The initial Context for your matchers.
   */
  context?: any,

  /**
   * The function that reduces segments into a Route object.
   */
  reducer?: Reducer<Segment, R>,
})
```

### Example

```js
let navigation = Navi.createMemoryNavigation({
  routes,
  url: '/test',
})
```
