Matchers are objects that map a [Request](../data-types/#request) and [Context](../../guides/routing-context) to their associated content, including views, data, and other information.

### Functions for creating matchers

While it's possible to create your own custom matchers, usually you'll use Navi's helper functions to create them. There are five basic functions that return matchers:

- [lazy()](#lazy)
- [map()](#map)
- [mount()](#mount)
- [redirect()](#redirect)
- [route()](#route)

Navi also provides a number of child-accepting functions that can be composed together to match multiple pieces of information with a single matcher. They can also be composed together with the [compose()](#compose). It may help to think of them as middleware.

- [withContext()](#withcontext)
- [withData()](#withdata)
- [withHead()](#withhead)
- [withHeaders()](#withheaders)
- [withStatus()](#withstatus)
- [withTitle()](#withtitle)
- [withView()](#withview)

Finally, if the above functions don't cover your needs, it is possible to write your own custom matchers. Matchers are functions that take a child and return a generator function, so you can write them with pure JavaScript.

`lazy()`
--------

```typescript
lazy(() => Promise<{ default: Matcher }>)
```

The `lazy()` function allows you to split out part of your matcher tree to a separate file, making it possible to declare routing trees for large projects which can't all be loaded at once.

Navi's `lazy()` function acts like React's `lazy()` function, accepting a function that returns a promise. Once the promise resolves, Navi will defer to the matcher on the resolved value's `default` property.


### Examples

```js
import { lazy, mount } from 'navi'

export default mount({
  '/': lazy(() => import('./landingRoute')),
  '/about': lazy(() => import('./aboutRoute')),
})
```


`map()`
-------

```typescript
map((request, context) =>
  Matcher |
  Promise<Matcher | { default: Matcher }>
)
```

The `map()` function allows you to decide on a matcher at runtime, based on the value of `request` and `context`. This is useful when you want to use a different child matcher depending on the circumstances.

### Examples

You can use `map()` when implementing [authentication](../../guides/authenticated-routes) to match a `route()` when the user is logged in, and a `redirect()` when the user is logged out.

```js
import { lazy, map, mount, redirect } from 'navi'

export default mount({
  '/members': map((request, context) =>
    context.isAuthenticated
      ? lazy(() => import('./membersRoute'))
      : redirect(request =>
          '/login?redirectTo='+encodeURIComponent(request.originalUrl)
        )
  ),
})
```


`mount()`
-------

```typescript
mount(paths: {
  [path: string]: Matcher
})
```

The `mount()` function returns a matcher that allows you to "mount" multiple child matchers at specified paths. The active matcher will then depend on the current URL.

This matcher transforms the `Request` object passed to child matchers by:

- Removing the matched part of the URL from the `path` and `url` properties
- Appending the matched path to the `mountpath` property

### Examples

#### Basic usage

This example specifies two URLs -- on '/about', a `route()` matcher is used that dynamically loads its view form another file, and on `/`, a matcher is mounted that redirects users to `/about`.

```js
//--- pages.js
import { mount, redirect, route } from 'navi'

export default mount({
  '/about': route({
    title: 'The createSwitch() function',
    getView: () => import('./about.mdx'),
  }),

  '/': redirect('./about'),
})
//--- index.js <-- index.js
//--- App.js <-- App.js
//--- styles.css <-- styles.css
//--- about.mdx
# About This Example

I'm afraid it ain't much to look at.

There ain't anything but this here about page. The `/` URL just redirects to `/about`, and here you are!
```


#### Nested mounts

You can compose multiple `mount()` matchers together -- just as you'd compose React components or Redux reducers. 

```js
export default mount({
  '/plans': mount({
    '/pro': route({
      title: 'Pro',
      getView: () => import('./pro-plan.mdx'),
    }),
    '/team': route({
      title: 'Team',
      getView: () => import('./team-plan.mdx'),
    }),
  }),

  '/': redirect('./plans/pro'),
})
```


#### The `/` path

Within the paths object, the `/` path is special; it is used to represent the content of the URL at which the `mount()` matcher itself is mounted at.

If you don't provide a `/` path for a `mount()`, then accessing it directly will result in a 404. For example, accessing `/plans` in this example will result in a 404.
 
```js
export default mount({
  '/plans': mount({
    '/pro': route({
      title: 'Pro',
      getView: () => import('./pro-plan.mdx'),
    }),
    '/team': route({
      title: 'Team',
      getView: () => import('./team-plan.mdx'),
    }),
  }),

  '/': redirect('./plans/pro'),
})
```

Because of this, it often makes sense to mount a redirect at the `/` path.


#### URL parameters

It's possible to specify wildcard segments in a `mount()` matcher's paths by starting segments with the `:` character. The values of these wildcard segments will be made available via your [`NaviRequest`](../data-types/#navirequest) objects' `params` property.

For example, the following `paths` object specifies that any URL of the form `/resource/:id`, where `:id` can be anything, maps to a route whose view and title depends on the result of `fetchResource(:id)`.

```js
export default mount({
  '/resource/:id': route(request => {
    let resource = await fetchResource(request.params.id)

    return {
      title: resource.title,
      content: resource.content,
    }
  })
})
```


`redirect()`
------------

```typescript
redirect(
  to:
    | string
    | Partial<URLDescriptor>
    | ((request, context) =>
        | string
        | Partial<URLDescriptor>
        | Promise<string | Partial<URLDescriptor>
      )
)
```

Redirects can be mapped to one of a map's paths to declare that any visits to that path will automatically navigate to the specified path.

The value of `to` can be an absolute path, a [partial URL descriptor](../data-types/#urldescriptor), or a getter function that returns either of these.

### Examples

Redirect to `/browse`, relative to the application root:

```js
redirect('/browse')
```

Redirect to `./browse`, relative to the path at which the redirect is mounted:

```js
redirect('./browse')
```

Redirect to `/login?redirectTo=...`, appending the current URL as parameter, so that the login screen can redirect back to it when complete:

```js
redirect(request =>
  '/login?redirectTo='+
  encodeURIComponent(request.mountpath+request.search)
)
```


`route()`
---------

```typescript
route(options: 
  {
    // Arbitrary information about this route, that will be merged with
    // `data` objects from any parent matchers.
    data?: object,
    getData?: (request, context) => object | Promise<object>,

    // <head> or <meta> tags that should be rendered when this route is
    // active.
    head?: any,
    getHead?: (request, context) => any | Promise<any>,

    // HTTP headers that should be sent to the client. This is only useful
    // when performing server side rendering.
    headers?: any,
    getHeaders?: (request, context) => object | Promise<object>,

    // The matched HTTP status code. This is only useful when performing
    // server side rendering.
    status?: any,
    getStatus?: (request, context) => number | Promise<number>,

    // The title that should be set within the `<title>` tag, and shown in
    // the browser's title bar.
    title?: string,
    getTitle?: (request, context) => string | Promise<string>,

    // Code to render this route. While you can pass anything in here,
    // typically you'll pass a React element or component.
    view?: any,
    getView?: (request, context) => any | Promise<any>,
  } |
  (request, context) => {
    data?: object,
    head?: any,
    headers?: object,
    status?: any,
    title?: string,
    view?: any,
  }  
)
```

Used to map multiple pieces of content to a URL.

There are two ways to use `route()`:

1. You can pass a getter function that maps `(request, context)` to an object containing your content.
2. You can pass an object that contains constant values, or getter functions for individual values.

In the second case, if `request.method` is equal to `"HEAD"`, then any getters for `view` and `head` won't be called. This is particularly useful when your app uses `router.resolveSiteMap()`, as it uses the `"HEAD"` method by default -- ensuring that the act of creating a site map doesn't fetch all of your app's views.

### Examples

#### Passing an object of props

```js
route({
  title: 'Frontend Armory',
  data: {
    language: "en",
  },
  head: <>
    Level up your JavaScript through interactive exercises and examples.
  </>,
  getView: () => import('./landing.mdx'),
})
```

#### Passing a getter function

```js
route(async (request, context) => {
  let view

  if (!context.currentUser || !context.currentUser.isPro) {
    view = <SubscribePage />
  }
  else {
    let { default: MDXDocument } = await import('./document.mdx')
    view = <MDXDocument currentUser={context.currentUser} />
  }

  return {
    data: {
      exclusiveTo: 'pro',
    },
    title: 'Mastering Asynchronous JavaScript'
    view,
  }
})
```


`withContext()`
-----------------

```typescript
withContext(
  getChildContext: (request, parentContext) => any | Promise<any>,
  child?: Matcher
)
```

The `withContext()` matcher sets the [Routing Context](../../guides/routing-context) within its children. It won't make any effort to merge in the parent context, but since the parent context is available via the getter function's second argument, you can merge it in yourself.

This matcher is useful for providing information that is shared by multiple children -- similar to [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

### Examples

Imagine that you're building a site with many online courses -- like Frontend Armory. Each course is composed of a number of nested `mount()` and `route()` matchers -- with one `route()` for each lesson. Context could be used to provide the course details to each of the nested pages.

```js
let context = withContext(
  (route, parentContext) => ({
    course,
    courseRoot: rount.mountpath,

    // Merge in the parent context
    ...parentContext,
  }),
  mount({
    // ...
  })
)
```


`withData()`
------------

```typescript
withData(
  dataOrGetter:
    object |
    (request, context) =>
      object |
      Promise<object | { default: object }>,
  child?: Matcher
)
```

Use `withData()` to add data to a Route's `data` property. If a child matcher adds data on the same properties as this matcher, then the child matcher's data will take precedence.


`withHead()`
------------

```typescript
withHead(
  headOrGetter:
    any |
    (request, context) =>
      any |
      Promise<any | { default: any }>,
  child?: Matcher
)
```

Use `withHead()` to add a value to a Route's `heads` array. The value will be prepended to any values added by any child matcher.


`withHeaders()`
---------------

```typescript
withHeaders(
  headersOrGetter:
    object |
    (request, context) =>
      object |
      Promise<object | { default: object }>,
  child?: Matcher
)
```

Use `withHeaders()` to add a HTTP headers to a Route's `headers` object. Any HTTP headers that a child matcher adds will take precedence of this matcher's headers.


`withStatus()`
--------------

```typescript
withStatus(
  statusOrGetter:
    number |
    (request, context) =>
      number |
      Promise<number | { default: number }>,
  child?: Matcher
)
```

Use `withStatus()` to add a HTTP status to a Route's `status` object. Any status added by a child matcher will take precedence.

### Example

The `route()` function automatically adds a 200 status if you don't specify one, but internally, it just uses `withStatus()`. Here's how you could do the same thing yourself:

```js
import { compose, map, mount, redirect, withStatus, withView } from 'navi'

mount({
  '/contact': map(async (request, context) => {
    if (request.method === 'POST') {
      try {
        await context.api.postContact(request.body)
        return redirect('/thankyou')
      }
      catch (error) {
        return compose(
          withView(<ContactForm error={error} />),
          withStatus(400)
        )
      }
    }
    else {
      return compose(
        withView(<ContactForm />),
        withStatus(200)
      )
    }
  })
})
```


`withTitle()`
-------------

```typescript
withTitle(
  titleOrGetter:
    string |
    (request, context) =>
      string |
      Promise<string | { default: string }>,
  child?: Matcher
)
```

Use `withTitle()` to specify a value for the matched Route's `title` string -- which will be used to set the page's `<title>` tag. Any title added by a child matcher will take precedence.


`withView()`
------------

```typescript
with(
  viewOrGetter:
    any |
    (request, context) =>
      any |
      Promise<any | { default: any }>,
  child?: Matcher
)
```

Use `withView()` to add a view to a Route's `heads` array. The value will be prepended to any values added by any child matcher.



## `compose()`

There are times when you'll want to associate multiple pieces of information with a single URL. For example, you may want to associate both a view, some data, and a title.

Matchers that accept a child argument can be composed in one of two ways:

-   You can pass a child matcher as a second argument. E.g.

    ```jsx
    withView(
      <About />,
      withData({
        language: 'en',
      })
    )

-   You can pass multiple matchers to the `compose()` function, which allows you to specify nested matchers like the above example using a flat list of argument:

    ```jsx
    compose(
      withView(<About />),
      withData({ language: 'en' }),
    )
    ```


## Custom Matchers

Matchers are functions that accept a child generator, and return a [Generator Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*) that outputs arrays of [Segment](../data-types/#segment) objects.

```js
type MatcherGenerator = (request: NaviRequest, context) => Iterator<Segment[]>
type Matcher = (child: MatcherGenerator) => MatcherGenerator
```

Why do matchers follow this signature?

Firstly, accepting a child generator as an argument allows for composition via a standard `compose()` function -- just like the one that [comes with](https://redux.js.org/api/compose) Redux. While some matcher-creating functions allow for a child to be passed in as a second argument, this is actually just sugar for specifying a default value for the matcher's `child` argument.

As for the generator function, it typically looks something like this:

```js
function* matcherGenerator(request, context) {
  while (busy) {
    segments = computeSegments(env.request, env.context)
    yield segments
  }
}
```

The generator function is called once for each combination of `request` and `context`. Given that the matcher's result may be asynchronous, it may not be possible to immediately return a value. However, given that there may be multiple matchers composed together, each emitting their own `Segment` objects, it may not be desirable to wait until *all* matchers have completed to see each result.

Generators are a useful way to solve this problem. A generator can immediately yield a **'busy'** segment that indicates that more data is to come, and then yield a final segment once it's available. In the meantime, it can call child generators and yield their results as appropriate.

Because matchers are just generators, it's possible to create your own matchers. As an example, it would be possible to create a `withTimeout()` function that returns a matcher that emits an error is its child matchers take too much time to resolve.
