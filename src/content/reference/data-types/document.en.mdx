These types are all exported for use within TypeScript codebases.

## `NaviRequest`

The `request` object passed to your matcher functions if of type `NaviRequest`, and contains information about the last requested URL.

```typescript
interface NaviRequest {
  /**
   * The path at which the matcher is mounted.
   */
  mountpath: string

  /**
   * The values of any URL parameters matched from parameter segments in the
   * URLs, pathname, along with information from the URL's query string.
   */
  params: { [name: string]: string }

  /**
   * An object containing the information from the URL's query string.
   */
  query: { [name: string]: string }

  /**
   * The raw URL query string, including any "?" character. E.g. "?q=test".
   */
  search: string

  /**
   * The URL hash string, including any "#" character. E.g. "#top".
   */
  hash: string

  /**
   * A HTTP method as an uppercase string. This defaults to "GET".
   */
  method: string

  /**
   * Contains the unmatched part of the request URL.
   */
  path: string

  /**
   * Contains the unmatched part of the request URL, as a string.
   * 
   * This is a string instead of a URLDescriptor, to be consistent
   * with the Request type for Express.
   */
  url: string

  /**
   * The originally requested URL.
   */
  originalUrl: string

  /**
   * The most recent routing context.
   */
  context: any

  /**
   * Contains the history state (from window.history.state) that was used
   * when processing this request in the browser.
   */
  state: any

  /**
   * When using the `crawl()` function, this will contain the function
   * that is used to map patterns within a `mount()` to more requests.
   */
  crawler?: Crawler

  body: any
  hostname: string
  headers: { [name: string]: string }
}
```


## `Route`

Your app's navigation state at any single time is represented by a `Route` object.

```typescript
type RouteType =
  | 'busy'
  | 'ready'
  | 'error'
  | 'redirect'

interface Route<Data = any> {
  type: RouteType
  url: URLDescriptor
  chunks: Chunk[]
  lastChunk: Chunk
  
  /**
   * When "type" is "redirect", contains the redirected to URL.
   */
  to?: string

  /**
   * When "type" is "error", contains the error object.
   */
  error?: any

  /**
   * An object containing merged values from all data chunks.
   */
  data?: Data

  /**
   * An object contains HTTP headers added by header chunks. 
   */
  headers: { [name: string]: string }

  /**
   * An array containing information meant to be added to the page <head>.
   */
  heads: any[]

  /**
   * Any state from window.history.state that was used associated with the
   * route.
   */
  state?: any

  /**
   * A HTTP status code.
   */
  status?: number

  /**
   * The title that should be set on `document.title`.
   */
  title?: string

  /**
   * An array of components or elements for rendering the route's view.
   */
  views: any[]
}
```

## `Chunk`

Within your `Route` object, state for each individual matcher is available through the `route.chunks` array. There are a number of possible chunk types.

```typescript
/**
 * This is used in place of a chunk of another type whose final result is
 * not yet known.
 */
export interface BusyChunk extends GenericChunk {
  type: 'busy'
  promise: PromiseLike<any>
}

/**
 * A chunk that is added for each crawled pattern.
 */
export interface CrawlChunk extends GenericChunk {
  type: 'crawl'
}

/**
 * Data chunks contain information that will be available on the produced
 * route object, but isn't meant to be rendered with the page itself.
 */
export interface DataChunk<Data=any> extends GenericChunk {
  type: 'data'
  data: Data
}

/**
 * When encountered in a route by a `<NavView>`, this will be thrown, and
 * can then be handled by an Error Boundary. Behavior for handling error
 * chunks on the server side is undefined.
 */
export interface ErrorChunk extends GenericChunk {
  type: 'error'
  error: any
}

/**
 * Can be used to specify data for your page's <head> separately from
 * the view content.
 */
export interface HeadChunk extends GenericChunk {
  type: 'head'
  head: any
}

/**
 * Used to specify any headers for your HTTP response.
 */
export interface HeadersChunk extends GenericChunk {
  type: 'headers'
  headers: { [name: string]: string }
}

/**
 * Mount chunks are added for each mount that is routed through. They're
 * useful for building site maps, as they hold metadata on other possible
 * paths.
 */
export interface MountChunk extends GenericChunk {
  type: 'mount'
  patterns: string[]
}

/**
 * When added to a route, indicates that the client should follow the redirect
 * to the given address.
 */
export interface RedirectChunk extends GenericChunk {
  type: 'redirect'
  to: string
}

/**
 * Specifies that history.state for this request should be set to the given
 * value.
 */
export interface StateChunk extends GenericChunk {
  type: 'state'
  state: any
}

/**
 * Used to specify the status of your HTTP response.
 */
export interface StatusChunk extends GenericChunk {
  type: 'status'
  status: number
}

/**
 * Allows matchers to specify a <title> tag, or document title.
 */
export interface TitleChunk extends GenericChunk {
  type: 'title'
  title: string
}

/**
 * Contains the full URL that should be used for the route, including any hash.
 */
export interface URLChunk extends GenericChunk {
  type: 'url'
  url: URLDescriptor
}

/**
 * View chunks contain data that will be used in a response on the
 * server, or that will be rendered in the browser. They can contain error
 * or redirect information, but they'll still be rendered as-is in the client.
 */
export interface ViewChunk<View=any> extends GenericChunk {
  type: 'view'
  view: View
}
```

## `URLDescriptor`

Most `url` objects within Navi are **URL Descriptor** objects, which have the following shape:

```typescript
type URLDescriptor = {
  /**
   * The URL's pathname part, starting from the first `/`, and ending
   * before any search string.
   * 
   * E.g. `/documents/hidden/`
   */
  pathname: string,

  /**
   * The URL's query part, including any `?` character. When there
   * is no query, it defaults to an empty string.
   * 
   * E.g. `?q=pants`.
   */
  search: string,

  /**
   * The URL's hash part, including any `#` character. When there
   * is no hash, it defaults to an empty string.
   * 
   * E.g. `#top`.
   */
  hash: string,

  /**
   * An object containing string values of parameters extracted from
   * the `pathname` or `search` properties. 
   */
  query: Params,

  /**
   * The full string URL. If this URL Descriptor was created from a
   * string that you passed in, then this will match your provided
   * string.
   */
  href: string,
}
```

When you're supplying a URL to Navi, you don't need to supply the entire object. You can just supply a **Partial URL Descriptor** that contains only some of the above properties, and the remaining properties will be given sane defaults.

In fact, you don't even need to supply objects at all -- whenever you need to pass Navi a URL, you can also pass it a URL string, like `/my-great-page?q=icecream#top`, and Navi will convert it into a URL object for internal use.
