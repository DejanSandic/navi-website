export const filename = __filename

These types are all exported for use within TypeScript codebases.

## `NaviRequest`

The `request` object passed to your matcher functions if of type `NaviRequest`, and contains information about the last requested URL.

```typescript
interface NaviRequest {
  /**
   * The path at which the matcher is mounted.
   */
  mountpath: string

  /**
   * The values of any URL parameters matched from parameter segments in the
   * URLs, pathname, along with information from the URL's query string.
   */
  params: { [name: string]: string }

  /**
   * A Router object, which can be used to make further requests.
   */
  router: Router<any, any>

  /**
   * An object containing the information from the URL's query string.
   */
  query: { [name: string]: string }

  /**
   * The raw URL query string, including the "?" character. E.g. "?q=test".
   */
  search: string

  /**
   * A HTTP method as an uppercase string. This defaults to "GET".
   */
  method: HTTPMethod

  /**
   * Contains the unmatched part of the request URL.
   */
  path: string

  /**
   * Contains the unmatched part of the request URL, as a string.
   * 
   * This is a string instead of a URLDescriptor, to be consistent
   * with the Request type for Express.
   */
  url: string

  /**
   * The originally requested URL
   */
  originalUrl: string

  body: any
  hostname: string
  headers: { [name: string]: string }
}
```


## `Route`

Your app's navigation state at any single time is represented by a `Route` object.

```typescript
type RouteType =
  | 'busy'
  | 'ready'
  | 'error'
  | 'redirect'

interface Route<Data = any> {
  type: RouteType
  url: URLDescriptor
  segments: Segment[]
  lastSegment: Segment
  
  /**
   * When "type" is "redirect", contains the redirected to URL.
   */
  to?: string

  /**
   * When "type" is "error", contains the error object.
   */
  error?: any

  /**
   * An object containing merged values from all data segments.
   */
  data?: Data

  /**
   * An object contains HTTP headers added by header segments. 
   */
  headers: { [name: string]: string }

  /**
   * An array containing information meant to be added to the page <head>.
   */
  heads: any[]

  /**
   * A HTTP status code.
   */
  status?: number

  /**
   * The title that should be set on `document.title`.
   */
  title?: string

  /**
   * An array of components or elements for rendering the route's view.
   */
  views: any[]
}
```

## `Segment`

Within your `Route` object, state for each individual matcher is available through the `route.segments` array. There are a number of possible segment types.

```typescript

/**
 * This is used in place of a segment of another type whose final result is
 * not yet known.
 */
interface BusySegment extends GenericSegment {
  type: 'busy'
  url: URLDescriptor
  promise: PromiseLike<any>
}

/**
 * Data segments contain information that will be available on the produced
 * route object, but isn't meant to be rendered with the page itself.
 */
interface DataSegment<Data=any> extends GenericSegment {
  type: 'data'
  url: URLDescriptor
  data: Data
}

/**
 * When encountered in a route by a `<NavView>`, this will be thrown, and
 * can then be handled by an Error Boundary. Behavior for handling error
 * segments on the server side is undefined.
 */
interface ErrorSegment extends GenericSegment {
  type: 'error'
  url: URLDescriptor
  error: any
}

/**
 * Can be used to specify data for your page's <head> separately from
 * the view content.
 */
interface HeadSegment extends GenericSegment {
  type: 'head'
  url: URLDescriptor
  head: any
}

/**
 * Used to specify any headers for your HTTP response.
 */
interface HeadersSegment extends GenericSegment {
  type: 'headers'
  url: URLDescriptor
  headers: { [name: string]: string }
}

/**
 * Map segments are added for each map that is routed through. They're
 * useful for building maps, as they hold metadata on other possible paths.
 */
interface MapSegment extends GenericSegment {
  type: 'map'
  url: URLDescriptor
  patterns: string[]
}

/**
 * Added in place of child segments when a child returns an empty list of
 * segments, to prevent the length of the segments list from decreasing.
 */
interface NullSegment extends GenericSegment {
  type: 'null'
  url: URLDescriptor
}

/**
 * When added to a route, indicates that the client should follow the redirect
 * to the given address.
 */
interface RedirectSegment extends GenericSegment {
  type: 'redirect'
  url: URLDescriptor
  to: string
}

/**
 * Used to specify the status of your HTTP response.
 */
interface StatusSegment extends GenericSegment {
  type: 'status'
  url: URLDescriptor
  status: number
}

/**
 * Allows matchers to specify a <title> tag, or document title.
 */
interface TitleSegment extends GenericSegment {
  type: 'title'
  url: URLDescriptor
  title: string
}

/**
 * Contains the full URL that should be used for the route, including any hash.
 */
interface URLSegment extends GenericSegment {
  type: 'url'
  url: URLDescriptor
}

/**
 * View segments contain data that will be used in a response on the
 * server, or that will be rendered in the browser. They can contain error
 * or redirect information, but they'll still be rendered as-is in the client.
 */
interface ViewSegment<View=any> extends GenericSegment {
  type: 'view'
  url: URLDescriptor
  view: View
}
```

## `SiteMap`

Contains an object mapping non-redirect URLs to `Route` objects, and an additional object containing any redirects. To generate a `SiteMap`, use the [`router.resolveSiteMap()`](../router/#routerresolvesitemap) method. 

```typescript
interface SiteMap {
  redirects: {
    [url: string]: string,
  }
  pages: {
    [url: string]: Route,
  }
}
```

## `URLDescriptor`

Most `url` objects within Navi are **URL Descriptor** objects, which have the following shape:

```typescript
type URLDescriptor = {
  /**
   * The URL's pathname part, starting from the first `/`, and ending
   * before any search string.
   * 
   * E.g. `/documents/hidden/`
   */
  pathname: string,

  /**
   * The URL's query part, including any `?` character. When there
   * is no query, it defaults to an empty string.
   * 
   * E.g. `?q=pants`.
   */
  search: string,

  /**
   * The URL's hash part, including any `#` character. When there
   * is no hash, it defaults to an empty string.
   * 
   * E.g. `#top`.
   */
  hash: string,

  /**
   * An object containing string values of parameters extracted from
   * the `pathname` or `search` properties. 
   */
  query: Params,

  /**
   * The full string URL. If this URL Descriptor was created from a
   * string that you passed in, then this will match your provided
   * string.
   */
  href: string,

  /**
   * The `state` object, as stored in your browser's `history` object.
   */
  state?: object,
}
```

When you're supplying a URL to Navi, you don't need to supply the entire object. You can just supply a **Partial URL Descriptor** that contains only some of the above properties, and the remaining properties will be given sane defaults.

In fact, you don't even need to supply objects at all -- whenever you need to pass Navi a URL, you can also pass it a URL string, like `/my-great-page?q=icecream#top`, and Navi will convert it into a URL object for internal use. The only exception to this rule is that when you need to provide a value for `state`, you'll need to use an object.
