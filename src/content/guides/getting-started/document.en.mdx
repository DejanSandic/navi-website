This guide will walk you through the process of adding routing to a fresh create-react-app project, using Navi.

## Basic Components

Navi's `<Router>` component lies at the top of most Navi apps. It lets you add declarative, asynchronous routing to your React app. To get started, just render a `<Router>` in the `index.js` file generated by create-react-app. You can declare your routes with Navi's `map()`, `route()` and other [matcher](../../reference/matchers) functions -- like so:

```
// code
```

Ok, so say you've got a `<Router>` with a couple routes: an English-language landing page and a Japanese-language landing page. Next step: you need to decide where to render the current route's `view` element. And to do that, you just plonk down a `<View />` somewhere inside your `<Router>`. It doesn't have to go *directly* inside the router; it could, for example, go inside a `<Layout>` component that renders some `<Link>` elements.

```
// code
```

// Isn't `<View>` part of react-native?
//
// It is! But react-native apps would be far better served by react-native-navigation or react-navigation than by navi.

But wait a minute... how can this work? The `getView()` function in your route returns an `import()`, which returns a Promise, and so at first there'll be nothing to render. Luckily, React's new [`<Suspense>`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactsuspense) feature lets you declaratively wait for promises to resolve. So just wrap your `<View>` in a `<Suspense>` tag, and you're off and racing!

```
// demoboard
```

## The Route Hooks

Ok, so see how your route defined `getData()` along with `getView()`? *How do you get the data?* With React hooks!

Navi's `useCurrentRoute()` hook can be called from any function component within the `<Router>` tag. It returns a [`Route`]() object that contains everything that Navi knows about the current URL.

```js
// demoboard
```

Ok. So far, so good. But imagine that you've just clicked a link to *another* page. That new page also probably depends on some asynchronous content that takes a while to load, so the new page may not be ready to display immediately.

What are you going to display in the meantime?

Well, the first option is to use `<Suspense>` to show a fallback while it's loading. But honestly, this would look a bit shit.

*gif*

//-- Suspense will grow the ability to handle this in the future, but it [could be a while]() before it's supported for static/server rendering.

What you'd *really* like to do is to display a loading bar over the current page while the next route loads... well, unless the transition only takes 100ms. Then you probably just want to keep displaying the current page until the next one is ready, because showing a loading bar for only 100ms also looks a bit shit.

*gif*

There's just one problem. Doing this with currently available tools is ridiculously hard, right? Well actually... You can add it to the above demo in just 2 lines of code, using the `useLoadingRoute()` hook and the `react-loading-indicator` package.

```js
demo
```

Here's how it works: `useCurrentRoute()` returns the most recent *completely loaded* route. And `useLoadingRoute()` returns any requested-but-not-yet-completely-loaded route. Or if the user *hasn't* just clicked a link, it returns `null`. Simple, huh?

## Error Boundaries

One of the things about asynchronous data and views is that sometimes they fail to load. Luckily, React has a great tool for dealing with things that might go kaboom: Error Boundaries.

Let's rewind for a moment to the `<Suspense>` tag that wraps your `<View />`.  When `<View />` encounters a not-yet-loaded route, it *throws a promise*, which effectively asks React to *please show the fallback for a moment*. You can imagine that `<Suspense>` catches that promise, and then re-renders its children once it resolves.

Similarly, if `<View />` finds that `getView()` or `getData()` have failed, then it throws an error. In fact, if the router encounters a 404-not-found, then `<View />` *also* throws an error. These errors can be caught by [Error Boundary]() components. For the most part, you'll need to make your own error boundaries, but Navi includes a `<NotFoundBoundary>` to show you how its done:

```
// demo
```

## What's Next?

You can get a long with Navi by just using these components and a few basic matcher functions. However, if you take a look underneath all the components, Navi is actually written in pure JavaScript -- that's why it's split into two packages:

- `navi` contains a pure JavaScript implementation of the core routing code
- `react-navi` gives you a thin wrapper around the core that's designed specifically for React

If you want to understand the full set of possibilities that Navi opens up, you'll want to understand the core concepts of Navi itself -- **requests**, **routes**, and **matchers**. As it happens, you've already run into each of these concepts in *this* page -- and we'll cover them in a moment. But first, let's take a brief look at URL parameters.
