It only takes a few small changes to set up static HTML generation for your app built with Navi and create-react-app:

1. `npm install navi-scripts --save-dev`
2. Import and call `register()` from `navi-scripts/register`
3. Implement your `main()` function
4. Update your `package.json`

I think you can handle the first step, but let me walk you through rest of it.

<Doc.Details aside title="Save effort with a starter">

You can skip the hard work of setting up static rendering by using a [starter project](../../create-react-navi-app).

`navi-scripts/register`
-----------------------

The `navi-scripts` tool is responsible for statically rendering your HTML. To cut a long story short, it works by:

1. Loading your already-built app bundle with [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom)
2. Inspecting your routes to build a list of your sites URLs, and then
3. Rendering each one using [ReactDOMServer.renderToString()](https://reactjs.org/docs/.react-dom-server.html#rendertostring)

There's one problem with this flow -- how does `navi-scripts` find your routes? create-react-app doesn't provide a way to export anything. So in order to tell Navi what to render, you'll need to import the `register()` function from `navi-scripts/register`, and then call it with your routes.

Usually, you'll want to call register in your app's entry point, i.e. `src/index.js`. Assuming that you're using the default `src/index.js` from create-react-app, here's what it'll look after importing and calling `register()`:

```jsx
import register from 'navi-scripts/register'
import routes from './routes'

register({
  // Specify the routes that navi-app should statically build
  routes,

  // If you pass an `App` component, `navi-scripts` will use it as the top
  // level component to be rendered for each page. If you don't pass an `App`
  // component, then a react-navi `<View>` will be rendered instead.
  exports: {
    App,
  },

  async main() {
    // ... we'll get to this in a moment ...
  }
})
```


Implementing `main()`
---------------------

In order to access your routes, `navi-scripts` loads your app bundle with jsdom. But given that jsdom isn't a real browser, actually *running* the app would result in weeping and gnashing of teeth. To get around this, `register()` accepts a `main()` function that is only called in real browsers -- it is *not* called during static build.

So what can you put in `main()`? Anything you want, really! But there are a few differences from what you'd put in a browser-only app.

### `render()` vs. `hydrate()`

When running in the `production` environment, you'll want to call `ReactDOM.hydrate()` instead of `ReactDOM.server()`. This lets React re-use the initial DOM, instead of rendering everything from scratch upon load.

```js
// React requires that you call `ReactDOM.hydrate` if there is statically
// rendered content in the root element, but prefers us to call
// `ReactDOM.render` when it is empty.
let hasStaticContent = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";
let renderer = hasStaticContent ? ReactDOM.hydrate : ReactDOM.render;
```

Since you can't use `<Suspense>` with `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()`, you'll need to manually wait for your intial route to load. This means that instead of using a `<Router>` component, you'll need to manually create a `navigation` object and pass it to a `<NaviProvider>` component.

```js
let navigation = Navi.createBrowserNavigation({
  routes,
  context: {
    // ...
  }
});

// Wait until the navigation has loaded the page's content, or failed to do
// so. If you want to load other data in parallel while the initial page is
// loading, make sure to start loading before this line.
await navigation.steady();
```

Finally, since `navi-scripts` doesn't call your `main()` function during static rendering, you'll need to make sure that your `main()` function is rendering the same thing as `navi-scripts`. Here's the rule:

- By default, `navi-scripts` renders a react-navi `<View />` for each route.
- But if you pass an `App` to the `exports` option of `register()`, that will be rendered instead.

Assuming you're happy with the default of just rendering a `<View />`, here's what your `register()` call will look like:

```jsx
import register from "navi-scripts/register";
import * as Navi from "navi";
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { NaviProvider, View } from "react-navi";
import routes from "./routes";

// `register()` is responsible for exporting your app's pages and App
// component to the static renderer, and for starting the app with the
// `main()` function when running within a browser.
register({
  // Specify the pages that navi-app should statically build, by passing in a
  // Switch object.
  routes,

  // This will only be called when loading your app in the browser. It won't
  // be called when performing static generation.
  async main() {
    let navigation = Navi.createBrowserNavigation({ routes });

    // Wait until the navigation has loaded the page's content, or failed to do
    // so. If you want to load other data in parallel while the initial page is
    // loading, make sure to start loading before this line.
    await navigation.steady();

    // React requires that you call `ReactDOM.hydrate` if there is statically
    // rendered content in the root element, but prefers us to call
    // `ReactDOM.render` when it is empty.
    let hasStaticContent = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";
    let renderer = hasStaticContent ? ReactDOM.hydrate : ReactDOM.render;

    // Start react, passing in the current navigation state via the
    // NaviProvider.
    renderer(
      <NaviProvider navigation={navigation}>
        <View />
      </NaviProvider>,
      document.getElementById("root")
    )
  }
});
```

## Update your `package.json`

To render your app, navi-scripts loads the result of the create-react-app's build script in a [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom). Because of this, you'll always need to run create-react-app's build script before running Navi's build script:

```bash
npx react-scripts build
```

Then, once you've added `register()` to your entry point and built it with create-react-app's build script, all that's left is to execute Navi's build script:

```bash
npx navi-scripts build
```

You can simplify the build process further by modifying the `build` script with in your `package.json` file to call both React *and* Navi's build scripts:

```js
"build": "react-scripts build && navi-scripts build"
```

After making this change, you can build your app by simply running your package's build script:

```bash
npm run build
```

And that's all there is to it! After running this command, you'll have HTML files in your `build` folder for every page and redirect. And to try them out, you can use Navi's included server:

```bash
npx navi-scripts serve
```


Custom renderers
----------------

By default, `navi-scripts` produces HTML by passing an `<App>` or `<View>` component to `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()`. However, if you need more control over this process, it's possible to configure a custom renderer.

To start, you'll need to create a `navi.config.js` file in your project's root directory. Then, to configure the custom renderer, you'll need to export a string that contains the location of a `renderPageToString.js` file. Here's how create-react-blog does this:

```js
// navi.config.js
export const renderPageToString = require.resolve('./src/renderPageToString')
```

Here's an example of a `renderPageToString.js` file that roughly matches the [default behavior](https://github.com/frontarm/navi/blob/8d11274c92d6492ccbe529ad17da980ffa61715d/packages/react-navi/create-react-app.js):

```js
// src/renderPageToString.js
const { renderCreateReactAppTemplate } = require('react-navi/create-react-app')

async function renderPageToString({ config, exports={}, routes, siteMap, dependencies, url }) {
  let canonicalURLBase = process.env.CANONICAL_URL || process.env.PUBLIC_URL || ''

  // Create an in-memory Navigation object with the given URL
  let navigation = Navi.createMemoryNavigation({
    routes,
    url,
  })

  // Wait for any asynchronous content to finish fetching
  let route = await navigation.getSteadyValue()

  // react-helmet thinks it's in a browser because of jsdom, so we need to
  // manually let it know that we're doing static rendering.
  Helmet.canUseDOM = false

  // Render the content
  let bodyHTML =
    ReactDOMServer.renderToString(
      React.createElement(
        NaviProvider,
        { navigation }, 
        React.createElement(exports.App || View)
      )
    )

  // This must be called after rendering the app, as stylesheet tags are
  // captured as they're imported
  let stylesheetTags = Array.from(dependencies.stylesheets)
    .map(pathname => `<link rel="stylesheet" href="${pathname}" />`)
    .join('')
  
  // Generate page head
  let helmet = Helmet.renderStatic();
  let metaHTML = `
    ${helmet.title && helmet.title.toString() || "<title>"+route.title+"</title>"}
    ${helmet.meta && helmet.meta.toString()}
    ${helmet.link && helmet.link.toString()}
  `
  
  // This loads the react-scripts generated index.html file, and injects
  // our content into it
  return renderCreateReactAppTemplate({
    config,
    insertIntoRootDiv: bodyHTML,
    replaceTitleWith:
      `<link rel="canonical" href="${canonicalURLBase+url.href}" />\n`+
      metaHTML+
      stylesheetTags,
  })
}

module.exports = renderPageToString
```


## HTTP redirects

By default, `navi-scripts` renders redirects as a HTML file with `<meta>`-based redirect. While this default will usually get the job done, it does have the issue of not being able to forward the URL `?search` through to the target URL. As a result, to use `?search` parameters with redirects, you'll need to set up HTTP redirects.

Unfortunately, there's no common standard between hosting platforms by which you can configure HTTP redirects. However, you can easily configure your own method for rendering redirects by exporting a `createRedirectFiles()` function from `navi.config.js`. Here's the default implementation that renders each redirect as a HTML file with a single `<meta>` tag.

```js
// The 'fs-extra' package mirrors Node's 'fs' packages, but its
// functions return promises, facilitating use within `async` functions.
import fs from 'fs-extra'
import path from 'path'

export async function createRedirectFiles({ config, siteMap }) {
  // The `siteMap.redirects` object contains all of the site's
  // redirects, mapping the "from" URL to the "to" URL.
  for (let [ url, to ] of Object.entries(siteMap.redirects)) {
    // Compute an `index.html` pathname instead of using the raw path.
    let pathname =
      url === '/'
        ? 'index.html'
        : path.join(url.split('?')[0].slice(1), 'index.html')

    console.log("[redirect] "+pathname+" -> "+to)

    let filesystemPath = path.resolve(config.root, pathname)
    let text = `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL='${to}'" />`

    // Make sure the directory exists before writing the redirect to
    // a file in the directory.
    await fs.ensureDir(path.dirname(filesystemPath))
    await fs.writeFile(filesystemPath, text)
  }
}
```
