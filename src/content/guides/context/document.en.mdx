Along with the latest request, matchers like `map()` and `route()` have access to an object called the **Context**. By default, the Context is just an empty object, but you can set it to anything you'd like.

There are two ways to set the Context: you can pass a prop to your `<Router>` element, or you can use the `withContext()` matcher. In fact, you can use *both* methods in the same app:

```js
// demo
```

## `withContext()`

The `withContext()` matcher lets you specify the context of its children as **a function of the current request and the parent context**.

```js
withContext((request, parentContext) => childContext, children)
```

For example, you could use `withContext()` to add a `rootpath` property to the context of its child matcher. This is useful for giving you a "base" path from which you can make your links.

<Doc.AsideTop>

```js
withContext(
  (request, parentContext) => ({
    ...parentContext,
    rootpath: request.mountpath,
  }),
  children
)
```

<Doc.Details aside title="A spoonful of sugar...">

If you're using `withContext()` inside a `composeMatchers()` function, then the specified context will apply to any subsequent arguments to `composeMatchers()`.

Because the `withContext()` function specifies context as a *function* of its parents' state, you can use it as often as you want. However, you'll need to be a little more careful about use of the `context` prop.


## The `context` prop

<Doc.AsideTop>

The `<Router>` component accepts a `context` prop, which you can use to set the Context for the routes that you've passed in. This is useful for passing in data and functions that you might want to use in your routes.

```js
<Router
  routes={routes}
  context={{
    api,
    currentUser,
    isStatic,
  }}
/>
```

<Doc.Details aside title="Context and Static/Server Rendering">

When performing static or server rendering, you'll need to imperatively set your routing context using [`navigation.setContext()`](/404).

</Doc.Details>
</Doc.AsideTop>

There's one thing to be careful about when passing Context this way: **every time the context changes, your entire Route will need to be recomputed**. This means re-running your `getView()` functions, `getData()` functions, and any other getters -- *even if they don't reference the Context*.

There is one saving grace: `<Router>` uses a shallow equality check to decide if `context` has changed, so you can still specify `context` as a plain old JavaScript object (like in the above example) -- so long as each of the object's values remain reference-equal. But be careful - if you're fetching data in your routes, then getting your `context` prop wrong can result in a lot of unnecessary network activity.

With this in mind though, Context is an incredibly useful tool. You can:

- Provide different APIs to routes in production and test environments.
- Create reusable routes whose links depend on where the root route is mounted.
- Switch the active route based on a user's authentication status.

Speaking of Authentication -- we'll use Context in the next guide to implement authenticated routes. I'll see you there!
