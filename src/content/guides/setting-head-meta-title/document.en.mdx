One of the major reasons for implementing static rendering is SEO -- so given that you've set up static rendering, you're also going to want to know how to render `<meta>`, `<title>`, and other `<head>` tags.

Actually, Navi gives you two ways to do this.

## Using react-helmet

Many React apps use the [react-helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet) package to manage their `<head>` tags. If you're statically rendering your app with `navi-scripts`, then react-helmet is supported out of the box! You can import and use the `<Helmet>` component like in any other app, and the helmet's `<title>` and `<meta>` tags will be statically rendered along with the rest of your content.

## Using `route()`

Navi's [`route()`](../../reference/#route) functions accepts `head` and `title` properties.

```jsx
//---
rightPanel: console
//--- index.js
import { createMemoryNavigation, mount, route } from 'navi'
import { Router } from 'react-navi'
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

const routes = mount({
  '/': route({
    title: 'My Great Page',
    head: <>
      <meta name="description" content="My Great description" />
      <script>
        console.log('hello from your document head')
      </script>
    </>,
    view: <div>My Great Page</div>
  })
})

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router routes={routes} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

Internally, `route()` uses Navi's `withHead()` and `withTitle()` functions -- you can use these manually to accomplish the same thing, to apply `<meta>` tags to multiple routes, or to set a fallback title.

When you declare a `head` or `title` using `route()`, `withHead()` or `withTitle()`, their values will be added to your Route object. This can be useful if you want to set their values from data read from the filesystem, a database, or an API.

As long as you're using Navi's `<View />` component, your route's `head` and `title` properties will be rendered using react-helmet -- just as if you'd specified them yourself using the `<Helmet>` component. This means that you can mix `<Helmet>` elements and `head` or `title` properties.
