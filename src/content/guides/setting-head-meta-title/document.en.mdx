Navi lets you define `title` and `head` tags with each call to `route()`:

```jsx
//---
rightPanel: console
//--- index.js
import { createMemoryNavigation, mount, route } from 'navi'
import { Router } from 'react-navi'
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

const routes = mount({
  '/': route({
    title: 'My Great Page',
    head: <>
      <meta name="description" content="My Great description" />
      <script>
        console.log('hello from your document head')
      </script>
    </>,
    view: <div>My Great Page</div>
  })
})

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router routes={routes} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

<Doc.Details aside title='Under the hood'>

Internally, `route()` uses Navi's `withHead()` and `withTitle()` functions -- you can use these manually to accomplish the same thing, to apply `<meta>` tags to multiple routes, or to set a fallback title.

</Doc.Details>

The resulting `title` and `head` objects will be available on the current `route` object -- but that's it. Navi won't automatically render these properties until you tell it *how* you'd like to render them. And currently, you have two options: `react-helmet` and `react-helmet-async`.


## The react-helmet and react-helmet-async integrations

Many React apps use [react-helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet) (and [react-helmet-async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet-async)) to manage their `<head>` tags, so Navi has special support for rendering your route `title` and `head` with helmet. Setup is simple: just add the `react-navi-helmet` or `react-navi-helmet-async` package, and wrap your app with the exported `HelmetProvider`:

```bash
npm install --save react-navi-helmet-async
```

<br />

```jsx
import HelmetProvider from 'react-navi-helmet-async'

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelmetProvider>
    <Router routes={routes}>
      ...
    </Router>
  </HelmetProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

With this, your `<View />` components will now know how to render their associated `title` and `head` properties. In fact, this will even work for static rendering using `navi-scripts`!
