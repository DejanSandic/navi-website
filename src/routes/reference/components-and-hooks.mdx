# Components and Hooks


## `<NavProvider>`

Your app's `<NavProvider>` component is responsible for subscribing to the latest navigation state, and passing that state to Navi's *other* components.

As a result, all other components must be rendered inside a `<NavProvider>`.

### Props

#### `navigation`: [`Navigation`](../../reference/navigation/#navigation-interface)

Your app's `Navigation` object, as returned from [`createBrowserNavigation()`](../../reference/navigation/#createbrowsernavigation) or [`createMemoryNavigation()`](../../reference/navigation/#creatememorynavigation)


## `<NavLink>`

This component can be used as a drop-in replacement for `<a>` tags. Internally, it renders an `<a>` tag so that statically rendered links will work even if JavaScript is disabled.

### Props

#### `active: boolean` <small>(optional)</small>

Allows you to explicit enable or disable the `activeClassName` and `activeStyle` props.

#### `activeClassName: string` <small>(optional)</small>

Will be added to your link's `className` if the app's current URL matches the `href` prop, or if the `active` prop is set to `true`.

#### `activeStyle: object` <small>(optional)</small>

Will be merged into your link's `style` if the app's current URL matches the `href` prop, or if the `active` prop is set to `true`.

#### `exact: bool` <small>(optional)</small>

If true, the link will only be considered to "match" the current URL if it is an *exact* match.

By default, a partial match at the beginning of the current URL will also be considered a match. This facilitates nav links, which often need to be highlighted when child pages are active.

#### `href: string` <small>(required)</small>

The url to navigate to; identical to the `href` attribute of a HTML `<a>` tag.

#### `precache: boolean` <small>(required)</small>

If specified, the linked page's content will be loaded as soon as the link is rendered.


## `<NavContent>`

Renders the content for the outermost `Switch` or `Page` which has content that hasn't been rendered yet.

If the content is a React element or component, then the `render` prop is optional, and that content will be rendered by default. Otherwise, you'll need to provide a render prop to specify how to render the route content. 

### Suspense

*Available from react-navi* ***0.10+***

When the page initially loads, it can be the case that *no* content is available -- even for previous routes. In this case, `<NavContent>` will use React Suspense to pause execution until content is available. By default, this will cause your `<NavProvider>` and everything inside it to be left blank until content is available, however, you can show a fallback element while loading anywhere outside the `<NavContent>` by wrapping it with React's `<Suspense fallback>` element -- just as you'd wrap a component that is returned by [`React.lazy()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#suspense).

As React doesn't yet support Suspense for server-side rendering, you'll want to avoid using `<Suspense>` for statically rendered apps. Instead, wait for Navi's initial content to render before calling `ReactDOMServer.render()` by using [`navigation.steady()`](../../reference/navigation/#navigationsteady).

### Props

#### <code>children: (content, segment, route) => React.ReactNode</code> <small>(optional)</small>

If provided, the component's `children` must be a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) that takes three the content, [Segment](../../reference/data-types/#segment) and [Route](../../reference/data-types/#route) objects, and returns React element to render.

If a `render` prop is not provided, the default behavior is:

1. If `route.content` contains a React element, render it.
2. If `route.content` contains a function, then call it to get the rendered content.
3. Otherwise, if `route.status` is `busy`, don't render anything. 
4. Finally, if `route.content` isn't a React element, and `route.status` isn't `busy`, then throw an error.

### Examples

#### Basic Usage

```js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NavProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <div className="App">
          <NavContent />
        </div>
      </NavProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Usage with render prop

By suppling a render prop, you can manually decide how to render your next route segment's content.

```js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NavProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <div className="App">
          <NavContent>
            {content => 
              React.isValidElement(content)
                ? content
                : React.createElement(content)
            }
          </NavContent>
        </div>
      </NavProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Usage with React Suspense

*Available from react-navi* ***0.10+***

By wrapping your content in a React [`<Suspense>`](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#suspense) element, you can specify a fallback element to display while your app's initial content is loading.

Note that this only makes sense for apps that are *not* pre-rendered with `ReactDOMServer.render()`. For static or server rendered apps, use [`navigation.steady()`](../../reference/navigation/#navigationsteady) to wait for the initial content to load before hydrating the pre-rendered HTML with `ReactDOM.hydrate()`.

```js
import { Suspense } from 'react'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NavProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <div className="App">
          <AppNavbar />
          <main>
            <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
              <NavContent />
            </Suspense>
          </main>
        </div>
      </NavProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

## `<NavLoading>`

A headless component that outputs the [`Route`](../../reference/data-types/#route) object for any page whose content is currently being fetche. If no page is currently being fetched, then it outputs `undefined`.

Use `<NavLoading>` to display a loading overlay when the user has requested a navigation that hasn't completed yet. 

### Example

```js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NavProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <NavLoading>
          {loadingRoute =>
            <div className="App">
              <BusyIndicator show={!!loadingRoute} />
              <NavContent />
            </div>
          }
        </NavLoading>
      </NavProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

## `<NavNotFoundBoundary>`

Catches `NotFoundError` exceptions thrown by `<NavContent />`.

### Props

#### `render: (error: NotFoundError) => React.Node`

### Example

```js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NavProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <NavLoading>
          {loading =>
            <Nav.NotFoundBoundary render={() =>
              <h1>Not Found</h1>
            }>
              <div className="App">
                <BusyIndicator show={loading} />
                <NavContent />
              </div>
            </Nav.NotFoundBoundary>
          }
        </NavLoading>
      </NavProvider>
    );
  }
}
```


## `<NavHistory>`

Allows you to access the [`history`](../../reference/history) property of your app's [`navigation`](../../reference/navigation) object, through a render prop passed to the `children` prop.

This can be used to facilitate programmatic navigation.


## `<NavRoute>`

Allows you to access the latest non-busy [`Route`](../../reference/data-types/#route), which can be useful when you need to know the URL of the current page.

Accepts a render prop which will receive the `Route` object.

### Example

```js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NavProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <NavRoute>
          {route =>
            <div>Current URL: <strong>{route.url.href}</strong></div>
          }
        </NavRoute>
      </NavProvider>
    );
  }
}
```
