# Requests, Routes and Matchers

<Blurb>

At its core, Navi is just a tool for mapping Requests to Routes; to accomplish this, it uses a pattern called *Matchers*.

</Blurb>


Requests and History
--------------------

Imagine that you've just clicked a link -- maybe the one that got you to this page. Your browser needs to ask a server somewhere for the content for that page, so it sends the server a **Request**. Requests can contain all sorts of information, but at the core of a Request is always a URL, like this one.

```text
https://frontarm.com/navi/core-concepts/
```

In modern browsers, the History API lets applications change the current URL *without* reloading the page or sending a new Request. Navi wraps the History API with an observable [history object](), and then uses it to keep track of the latest URL. For simple apps, this is all you'd really need from a router -- it lets you render changes in response to navigation, and it lets you programatically navigate by calling methods of the `history` object:

```js
// Update the URL, adding a new entry to the browser history
history.push('/what-are-we-going-to-do-today-brain')

// Update the URL by overwriting the last history entry
history.replace('/the-same-thing-we-do-everyday-pinky')
```

Navi's `history` object is managed by the same [history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/history) package as react-router, smoothing integration between the two libraries.

But for larger apps, just knowing the URL isn't enough. You also need to know what data and code are associated with each URL. And in a Navi app, you can find this information in **Route** objects.


Routes
------

Imagine that you've just clicked a link. Before the browser can display the new page, it'll need to fetch the information that is required to render that page.

What kind of information is necessary to render the link that you clicked?

- The document `<title>`
- Any metadata in the document `<head>`
- A number of React components and elements, including possibly a site-wide layout
- Any data that will be passed to those React components

In a Navi app, each Request maps to a `Route` object that contains everything needed to render that Request. The shape of your `Route` objects is configurable, but usually it'll look something like this:

```jsx
let route = {
  url: {
    pathname: '/navi/core-concepts/',
    // ...
  }  
  segments: [/* ... */],
  title: "Core Concepts",
  heads: [
    <meta name="description" content="amazeballs" />,
  ],
  views: [
    <NaviLayout />,
    <NaviMDXLayout MDXComponent={/* ... */} />,
  ],
  data: {
    language: 'en',
  },
}
```

Once you have the `Route` object that corresponds to a given Request, rendering it is simple -- and the React components in the `react-navi` package make it even simpler.

But let's say that you have a Request, and you want a `Route`. Getting that `Route` can be trickier than you may first  think:

- The views and data in the `Route` object may come from multiple disparate sources.
- You'll want to fetch any dependencies in parallel if at all possible.
- The `<AppLayout />` might be shared over the entire sites routes, while the `<PageLayout />` probably isn't.
- The data might depend on URL parameters or the URL query.

Navi's key innovation is that it lets you avoid all this and effortlessly declare mappings between URLs and `Route` objects, using a mechanism called **Matchers.**


Matchers
--------

Imagine that you've just clicked a link (you should be pretty good at this by now), and your browser has navigated to a new URL:

```text
https://frontarm.com/navi/core-concepts/
```

Looking at this URL, you can infer a few things about the result:

- Because the URL is under `/navi`, it'll use a `<NaviLayout>` element to render a sidebar on the left.
- The content for `/navi/core-concepts` is written with Markdown, so there'll be a `<NaviMDXLayout>` element.
- There's no language specified in the query string, so it's going to default to English.

Navi lets you specify each of these rules as individual **Matchers** -- objects that map Requests to individual **Segments** of data within your Route. For example, here are some segments that represent the above URL:

```jsx
{
  type: 'view',
  url: '/navi',
  view: <NaviLayout />,
}

{
  type: 'view',
  url: '/navi/core-concepts',
  view: <NaviMDXLayout MDXComponent={/* ... */} />,
}

{
  type: 'data',
  url: '/navi/core-concepts',
  data: { language: 'en' },
}
```

Your Route is then created by reducing all of the matched segments into a single `Route` object.

```jsx
let route = {
  url: {
    pathname: '/navi/core-concepts/',
    // ...
  }  
  segments: [
    {
      type: 'view',
      url: '/navi',
      view: <NaviLayout />
    },
    {
      type: 'view',
      url: '/navi/core-concepts',
      view: <NaviMDXLayout MDXComponent={/* ... */} />
    },
    {
      type: 'data',
      url: '/navi/core-concepts',
      data: { language: 'en' }
    },
  ],
  views: [
    <NaviLayout />,
    <NaviMDXLayout MDXComponent={/* ... */} />,
  ],
  data: {
    language: 'en',
  },
}
```

Ok, so **matchers** map **requests** to individual chunks of data called **segments** -- which are then reduced into **routes**. But how do you write matchers? Actually, *you probably won't*. Because while it's entirely *possible* to write custom matchers (<small>they're just [generator functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*)</small>), Navi already includes all of the matcher-creating functions that you'll ever realistically need.

For example, you could use [`map()`](../reference/matchers/#map) and [`withView()`](../reference/matchers/#withview) to map URL paths to views:

```jsx 
map({
  '/navi': withView(<NaviLayout />)
})
```

Or you could nest [`withData()`](../reference/matchers/#withdata) within [`withView()`](../reference/matchers/#withview) to match a URL to both its view *and* its data:

```jsx
map({
  '/navi':
    withView(
      <NaviLayout />,
      map({
        '/core-concepts':
          withView(
            async request => {
              let language = request.params.language || 'en'
              let { default: MDXComponent } =
                await import(`./core-concepts.${language}.mdx`)

              return <NaviMDXLayout MDXComponent={MDXComponent} />
            },
            withData(request => ({
              language: request.params.language || 'en',
            }))
          )
      })
    )
})
```

You could also use [`composeMatchers()`](../reference/matchers/#composematchers) to improve readability by *composing* matchers instead of *nesting* them, and you could use dynamic `import()` to split matchers over multiple chunks -- improving scalability:

```jsx
map({
  '/navi': composeMatchers(
    withView(<NaviLayout />),
    map({
      '/core-concepts': () => import('./coreConcepts.js')
    })
  )
})
```

And given that your routes have both a `view` and `data`, you could simplify things even further by specifying them both with [`route()`](../reference/matchers/#route) -- along with the page's `title` and any `head` tags.

```jsx
map({
  '/core-concepts': route(async request => {
    let language = request.params.language || 'en'
    let { default: MDXComponent } =
      await import(`./core-concepts.${language}.mdx`)
    
    return {
      title: 'Core Concepts â€“ Navi',
      head: <meta name="description" content="amazeballs" />,
      data: { language },
      view: <NaviMDXLayout MDXComponent={MDXComponent} />
    }
  })
})
```

Navi puts a bunch of other matchers at your disposal -- for details, see the [Matchers Reference](../reference/matchers). But with this said, in most situations you'll need no more than `map()`, `route()` and `withView()` -- just like in the following example.

```jsx
//---
editorPathname: /App.js
//--- pages.js <-- pages.js
//--- App.js <-- App.js
//--- index.mdx <-- index.mdx
//--- getting-started.mdx <-- getting-started.mdx
//--- index.js <-- index.js
//--- styles.css <-- styles.css
```

One curious thing about the `Route` objects in these examples that you might have noticed, is that `Route` can have multiple view elements. This is how Navi handles nested layouts -- which we'll discuss on the next guide. See you there!
