# Layout and Nested Content

In this example, the navbar along the top is rendered by the `Layout` component, which is set as the content for the app's root switch.

This makes the `pages.js` file effectively independent from the rest of the app, allowing it to be mounted inside another app -- just as Navi's documentation is mounted within Frontend Armory.
